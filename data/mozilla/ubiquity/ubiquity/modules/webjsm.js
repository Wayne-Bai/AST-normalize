// = WebJsModule =

// The {{{WebJsModule}}} class is used when it's desirable to have JavaScript
// libraries that were originally intended for use on the web be
// accessible from JS Modules.
//
// Generally, this is done by using an always-existing DOM window to
// host the JS library in chrome space and provide direct access to it.
// This ensures that all standard globals the code expects to exist,
// such as {{{window}}} and {{{XMLHttpRequest}}}, actually exist.
//
// Note, however, that since the code is running in chrome space,
// care must be taken to ensure that any JS libraries loaded don't load
// remote code from untrusted sources.

// The constructor requires a callback function, which is called when the
// {{{WebJsModule}}} is finished initializing itself. Optionally, the
// constructor can also take an instance of a DOM window, which it will
// use to host any JS code. If unspecified, the hidden DOM window is
// used.
