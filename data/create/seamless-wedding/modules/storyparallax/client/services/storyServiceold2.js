She’s attending Seattle Pacific University, and every Sunday she commutes across the lake to attend church and spend time with friends afterward. Finally, they’re running in the same circles, and she begins to realize that Jonathan’s quite a guy—charming and grounded, someone she considers the \“calm to her storm.\” He thinks she’s spontaneous and fun, and loves a partner for adventure. By the time the New Year rolls around, they’re hanging out one-on-one.",

Jonathan makes some unfortunate attempts to speak French and Mackenzie corrects his accent, completely charmed by his efforts. Their conversation continues over a warm cup of coffee and concludes with a trip to Kerry Park, where they gaze out at the Seattle night skyline. He asks her to be his girlfriend and they begin dating. Mackenzie’s weeks are a whirlwind of school, crew and struggling to get enough sleep, and Jonathan’s busy with school, too, but he drives to SPU from Bellevue every weekend so they can spend time together. After graduating, Mackenzie gets her first apartment in the U-District, just minutes away from Jonathan’s house. Hallelujah!",
                five: "The week before Jonathan proposes, he reschedules their upcoming date. Mackenzie assumes that there’s no way he’s proposing that night. \“He wouldn’t reschedule,\” she thinks. \“He’s way too much of a planner to do that.\” It’s February 1st, 2014. He takes what she thought to be a strange route to Gasworks Park, and that’s when she starts to suspect something. They walk to the large hill to watch the sunset, and as they’re sitting on their blanket, Jonathan, earnest and teary-eyed, pops the question. Mackenzie’s in shock—she can’t believe it’s really happening. Naturally, she accepts. They celebrate with dinner at her favorite Italian restaurant, followed by dessert, her favorite meal, at Aqua El-Gaucho on the pier.",
