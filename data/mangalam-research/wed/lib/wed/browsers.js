// Yes, testing features rather versions or specific browsers is the
// way to go, generally speaking. However, when we are working around
// bugs in *specific versions* of *specific browsers*, feature testing
// is mostly useless. So... here we are.
//
// Note that symbols are introduced for purely ad-hoc reasons. If we
// need to test for a specific combination somewhere in wed's code
// base, we have a flag. If we don't need the test, we don't have a
// flag.
//
// Also this code only satisfies the interests of wed. Don't take the
// tests here as gospel. If *you* need to test for some combinations
// that wed does not care about, you may find that the code here gives
// incorrect results relative to *your* goals. This code is meant to
// give correct results only relative to what wed cares
// about. (Salient example: wed is not designed (at this time) to run
// in tablets or phones. So the tests below don't take into account
// what might happen when running in a tablet or phone.)
