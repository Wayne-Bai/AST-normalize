/// This will initiate all the complex behind-the-scene work, to load product
/// data from the servers and restore whatever already have been

///
/// Note that you can call this method again later during the application
/// execution to re-trigger all that hard-work. It's kind of expensive in term of
/// processing, so you'd better consider it twice.
///
/// One good way of doing it is to add a "Refresh Purchases" button in your
/// applications settings. This way, if delivery of a purchase failed or
/// if a user wants to restore purchases he made from another device, he'll
/// have a way to do just that.
///
/// ##### example usage

/// ```js
///    // ...
///    // register products and events handlers here
///    // ...
///    //
///    // then and only then, call refresh.
///    store.refresh();
/// ```
